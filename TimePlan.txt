The page will include a timer counting down to christmas, as well as an
input field where the user can input a message that will be saved to
localStorage and displayed on the page with a timestamp.

The page will contain elements including a statement describing whether
it's christmas right now or not (or if it's far away or not), it will also
contain a timer counting down to the next christmas.
In addition it will include a text input element with a submit-button where 
the user can write a message and submit it, and messages will be displayed
underneath in cards.

The point of the page is to give people who love christmas a space to hang
out and appreciate it all year round, whilst waiting for the next christmas
to come around.

The target is to start as early as possible, in order to have as much time
as possible to figure all the different elements out, and to allow time to
fix bugs or errors that will inevitably come along.
